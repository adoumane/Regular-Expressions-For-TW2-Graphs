\begin{theorem}\label{app-thm:Rec->Reg}
Let $L$ be a language of $\TWT$ graphs. If $L$ is recognizable then it is regular. 
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Pure decomposition of a graph}

We  decompose recursively every pure graph into its \emph{heredidatary pure components}. We relay on the structure analysis of $\TWT$ graphs made in ~\cite{Cosme-LlopezP17}.
On fait cette decomposition en deux étapes.  Every pure graph $G$ can be written as a guarded substitution $G=S[\vec{H}/\vec{x}]$,  where $\vec{H}$ is a list of pure graphs, and  $S$, called the \emph{skeleton} of $G$, is either a word graph,  a multiset graph or a \emph{tree-like} graph, introduced below. \todo{Help from Denis.}

%The graphs $\vec{H}$ are either atomic or pure. The \emph{pure components of $G$} are its first layer components which are pure, together with their pure components.    

\begin{definition}[Tree-like graphs]
A \emph{tree} is a connected acyclic graph (without interface) with no parallel edges\footnote{Acyclicity prevents parallel binary edges, but we want to prevent also parallel unary edges.}.
 
The \emph{rays} of a domain graph $G$ are the binary edges connected to its input, its \emph{spots} are the non-input vertices incident to the rays. 
%We denote by $R(G)$ the labels of the rays. 
 
We say that $G$ is \emph{tree-like} if, when we remove its rays, we obtain a tree whose leaves are spots  (but some spots may not be leaves).   
 
\emph{Left-parallel} graphs are those graphs whose domain is a tree-like graph.
 \end{definition}
 The dashed lines and the red vertices are respectively the rays and the spots of the following domain graphs. 
 The left graph is tree-like, but the right one is not.
  \begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.4]{tree-like}
\end{center}
%We denote by $\G_\mathsf{s}$, $\G_\mathsf{p}$, $\G_\mathsf{d}$, $\G_\mathsf{t}$, $\G_\mathsf{w}$, $\G_\mathsf{m}$, $\G_\mathsf{\tau}$ and  $\G_\mathsf{u}$ the set of series, parallel, domain, test, word, multiset, tree-like and non-trivial unary graphs.  
%\begin{definition}
%We define \emph{left series-parallel} terms $T_\mathsf{lsp}$, \emph{left parallel} terms $T_\mathsf{lp}$  and \emph{tree-like} terms $T_\tau$ as follows:
%$$\begin{array}{lrlr}
%T_\mathsf{lsp}\qquad\qquad&t, u:=&t\cdot a \cdot b \ \mid\ t \cdot b \ \mid\ t\parallel u \ |\ b&\quad (a\in A_1,\  b\in A_2\cup A_2^\circ).\\
% T_\mathsf{lp}\quad&t:=& u\parallel v&\quad (u,v \in T_\mathsf{lsp}). \\
%T_\tau & t:=&\dom(u\cdot a)& \quad (u\in T_\mathsf{l}).
%\end{array}$$
%We call their graphs respectively \emph{left series-parallel},  \emph{left parallel} and \emph{tree-like} graphs, and denote their set by $\G_\mathsf{lsp}, \G_\mathsf{lp}$ and $\G_{\tau}$ respectively.  
%If $G$ is a tree like graph, we call its \emph{rays} the edges connected to the input. We denote by $R(G)$ the set of letters labeling them.
%\end{definition}
%Tree-like graphs are called so because when we remove their rays, the obtained graph is a tree. Here is an example of a left parallel graph in the left, and a tree-like graph in the right (we did not draw the labels and the orientation of the edges). The rays are the dashed edges.

\begin{proposition}[First-layer decomposition]Let $G$ be a pure graph.
\begin{itemize}
\item  If $G$ is parallel, then  $G=M[ \vec{H}/\vec{x}]$, where $M$ is a multiset and the graphs of $\vec{H}$ are series.
\item  If $G$ is a test, then  $G=M[ \vec{H}/\vec{x}]$ where $M$ is a multiset and the graphs of $\vec{H}$ are domain.
\item If $G$ is series, then  $G=W[ \vec{H}/\vec{x}]$ where $W$ is a word and each graph of $\vec{H}$ is either parallel, domain, test or a letter.
\item If $G$ is domain, then  $G=T[ \vec{H}/\vec{x}] $ where $T$ is tree-like, every graph in $\vec{H}$ is either parallel, domain, test or a letter and for every $x\in\vec{x}$, the $x$-labeled edges of $T$ are not rays.
\end{itemize}
The graph $M$, $W$ or $T$ is a \emph{skeleton} of $G$. The graphs of $\vec{H}$ are called the \emph{first-layer components} of $G$, we denote them by $\mathsf{FLC}(G)$. 

The first-layer components of graph are unique, and the skeleton is unique up to renaming and reorientation of its edges.  
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Follows from results in ~\cite{Cosme-LlopezP17}.
\end{proof}
Here is a picture illustrating the first-layer components of a graph:
\begin{center}
Picture
\end{center}
 We define the \emph{hereditary components}  of a graph, recursively, as the union of its first-layer components, with the hereditary components of its first-layer components. 
\begin{definition}[Hereditary decomposition]
 We define the \emph{hereditary components}  of a graph $G$, denoted $\mathsf{HC}(G)$,  recursively as follows:
 $$ \mathsf{HC}(G) = \mathsf{FLC}(G) \cup \underset{H\in\mathsf{FLC}(G)}{\bigcup}  \mathsf{HC}(H)$$
\end{definition}

%\begin{definition}[Pure components of a pure graph] If $G$ is a pure graph, we can write it as:
%$$
%\begin{array}{lll}
%G=W[ \vec{H}/\vec{x}], &W\in \G_\mathsf{w},\ \vec{H}\subseteq \mathcal{G}_\mathsf{p}\cup\mathcal{G}_{\mathsf{u}}, &     \text{if $G$ is series,}\\
%  G=M[\vec{H}/\vec{x}], &M\in \G_\mathsf{m},\  \vec{H}\subseteq \mathcal{G}_\mathsf{s}, & \text{if $G$ is parallel,}\\
%   G=M[\vec{H}/\vec{x}], &M\in \G_\mathsf{m},\  \vec{H}\subseteq\mathcal{G}_{\mathsf{d}},& \text{if $G$ is test,} \\
%   G=T[\vec{H}/\vec{x}, \vec{M}/\vec{y}], & T\in \G_\tau,\  \vec{H}\subseteq \mathcal{G}_\mathsf{p}\cup \G_\mathsf{u},\  \vec{M}\subseteq \mathcal{G}_\mathsf{m}\cap \G_{\mathsf{p}}\ \text{ and }\ \vec{y}\subseteq R(T), &  \text{if $G$ is domain,} 
%\end{array}
%$$
%where all the substitutions above are guarded.  We call the graphs  $W, M$ and $T$ the \emph{skeleton} of $G$, and the graphs $\vec{H}$ and $\vec{M}$ the \emph{first-layer components} of $G$. 
%\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Decomposition of impure graphs]
If $G$ is an impure $\TWT$ graph, then $G=M[\vec{H}/\vec{x}]$ where $M$ is a multiset, $\vec{H}$ are pure graphs and this substitution is guarded. 

 The \emph{first-layer components} of $G$ are the graphs $\vec{H}$ appearing in any such decomposition, which is not unique in general. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{remark} Notez qu'on n'a \textbf{pas} défini une decomposition herediataire dans le cas impure. \todo{french}
\end{remark}
Un premier resultat dont on aura besoin, c'est que lorqu'on remplace un hereditary component d'un graph par une letter, alors cette lettre est guardée.

\begin{proposition}
If $G$ is a pure graph and $M$ a hereditary component of $G$ of type  $\tau$, then $x$ is $\tau$-guarded in $G[x/M]$.

If $G$ is an impure $\TWT$ graph and $M$ a first-layer component of $G$ of type $\tau$, then $x$ is $\tau$-guarded in $G[x/M]$.


\end{proposition}

En plus d'être guardée, elle occuppe une position principale. Technical definition.\todo{en dire plus?}

\begin{definition}[principal letter]
We say that a letter $x$ is \emph{secondary} in a graph $G$ if there is a unary module $M$ of the form $\dom(x)$ or $\dom(x\parallel H)$ where $H$  is a module of $G$.
A letter is \emph{principal} if it is not secondary.
\end{definition}
Here is a picture illustrating the two cases where  $x$ is secondary:
% 
%\begin{lemma}\label{app-lem:no-pure-comp}
%Let $G$ be a graph such that $\mathsf{pure}(G)=\emptyset$.
%If $G$ is series, then it is a word graph. If $G$ is parallel, test or impure, then it is a multiset graph. If $G$ is domain, then it is a tree-like graph. 
%\end{lemma}


\begin{lemma}\label{app-lem:pure-substitution}
Let $G, H$ be pure graphs such that $G[H/x]$ is guarded and suppose that $x$ is principal in $G$. We have: 
$$\mathsf{HD}(G[H/x])\subseteq  \mathsf{HD}(G)[H/x] \cup \mathsf{HD}(H) \cup \set{H} $$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We proceed by induction on the structure of $G$. 
\end{proof}


\subsection{Type respecting algebra}

\begin{definition}
Let  $\A$ be an algebra whose domain is $D$. We say that $\A$ is \emph{type respecting} if we can find subsets $D_\mathsf{atomic}$, $D_\mathsf{pure}, D_\mathsf{impure}, D_\mathsf{s}, D_\mathsf{p}, D_\mathsf{d}, D_\mathsf{t}$, $D_\mathsf{lp}$ and $D_\mathsf{\tau}$ of the domain $D$, such that for every term $t$, its graph is pure, impure,  series, parallel, domain, test, left-parallel or tree-like, if and only if the evaluation of $t$ belongs to theses sets respectively.  
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{app-prop:type-respecting-rec}
If $L$ is a recognizable language of $\TWT$ graphs, then  it is recognizable by a type respecting algebra.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}\todo{french}
D'abord remarquer que les tree like graphes sont generés par une syntaxe. Et c'est ça qui fait que c'est facile de se rappeler d'eux.
We need to remember only a finite amount of information to know whether a graph is in each of these sets. 
\end{proof}





\subsection{Recognizable implies regular}

We can proceed to the Proof of Theorem~\ref{app-thm:Rec->Reg} Let $L$ be a recognizable language. By Prop.~\ref{app-prop:type-respecting-rec}, we can assume that $L$ is recognized by a type respecting algebra, and keep the same notations used there. Let $h$ be a homomorphism recognizing $L$, and $F\subseteq D$ such that $L=h^{-1}(F)$. We define $L_r$ as the language of graphs whose image (by $h$) is $r$. Our goal is to show that $L_r$ is regular for every $r\in D$. This is enough to conclude because 
$L=\underset{r\in F}{\bigcup}L_r$.
\medskip

First, we will show that $L_r$ is regular when {$r\in D_\mathsf{pure}$}. 
\medskip

  Let $A_\mathsf{pure}$ be a alphabet containing a binary letter for each element of the set $D_\mathsf{s}\cup D_\mathsf{p}$, and a unary letter for each element of  $D_\mathsf{d}\cup D_\mathsf{t}$. If $r\in D_{\mathsf{pure}}$, we denote by $x_r$ its corresponding letter in $A_\mathsf{pure}$. We extend $h$  to terms over  $A\cup A_\mathsf{pure}$, by letting $h(x_r)=r$ for every $r\in D_\mathsf{pure}$.
\smallskip

Let $P \subseteq  D_{\mathsf{pure}}$, $\Sigma\subseteq A_\mathsf{pure}$ and $r\in D$. We define $L^{P,\Sigma}_r$ as the set of graph terms over the alphabet $A\cup \Sigma$ defined as follows. We let $G\in L^{P,\Sigma}_r$  if and only if:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The image of $G$ is $r$.
\item The image of every pure components of $G$ belongs to $P$.
\item For every $v\in D_\mathsf{\tau}$ such that $x_v$ appears in $G$, $x_v$ is principal and $\tau$-guarded in $G$.
\end{enumerate}


\noindent We show, by induction on the size of $P$, that $L^{P, \Sigma}_s$ is regular  if  the letters associated to $P$ and the set $\Sigma$ are disjoint. We start by the inductive step.
\smallskip

 \noindent \textbf{Inductive step.} Suppose that $P=Q\uplus \set{v}$. We prove the following equality:
$$L^{P,\Sigma}_r=L^{Q,\Sigma\cup\set{x_v}}_r[\mu x_v. L^{Q,\Sigma\cup\set{x_v}}_v/x_v][L^{Q,\Sigma}_v/x_v] \qquad\qquad(\star) $$
Substitutions and iterations in $(\star)$ are guarded thanks to the conditions 3 and 4 above. 
Using this equality and the induction hypothesis, we can conclude that the language $L^{P,\Sigma}_r$ is regular. 


The right-to-left implication follows from Lem.~\ref{app-lem:pure-substitution}.  Let us show the other inclusion. 

\noindent A \emph{$v$-component} of a graph is a pure component of this graph whose image by $h$ is $v$.  The \emph{$v$-reduct} of a graph is the graph obtained by replacing every $v$-component by the letter $x_v$, such that the resulting graph has no $v$-components.  Let $G$ be a graph in  $L^{P,\Sigma}_r$,  we let: 
\begin{itemize}
\item $H$ be the $v$-reduct of $G$,
\item $S$ be the set of $v$-reducts of the $v$-components of $G$.
\item $T$ be the set of $v$-components of $G$, which do not contain further $v$-components.
\end{itemize}
We have the following inclusions: 
$$G\in H[\mu x_r. T/x_r][S/x_r],\quad H\subseteq L^{Q,\Sigma\cup\set{x_v}}_r,\quad S\subseteq L^{Q,\Sigma\cup\set{x_v}}_v\ \  \text{ and }\ \ T\subseteq L^{Q,\Sigma}_v.$$
This concludes the left-to-right inclusion of $(\star)$, and  the inductive step. Now let us treat the base case.  We have two base cases, one of them will make a call to the inductive step. 
\medskip


 \noindent \textbf{Base case 1.} $P$ is empty and $r\in D_\mathsf{s}\cup D_\mathsf{p}\cup D_\mathsf{t}$. Then the graphs of $L^{\emptyset,\Sigma}_r$ are either word graphs or multiset graphs. Their regularity follow from the case of words and commutative words.
\medskip

\begin{observation}
Using base case 1 and the inductive step, we have that 
$L^{P,\Sigma}_r$ is regular if $r\in D_\mathsf{s}\cup D_\mathsf{p}\cup D_\mathsf{t}$ and $P\subseteq D_\mathsf{s}\cup D_\mathsf{p}\cup D_\mathsf{t}$. 
\end{observation}
\medskip

\noindent \textbf{Base case 2.} $P$ is empty and $r\in D_\mathsf{d}$.  The graphs of $L^{\emptyset,\Sigma}_r$ are tree-like graphs. 
Let $S$ be the set of pairs $(v,a)$ such that $v\in D_{\mathsf{lp}}$, $a\in A_1$ and $r=\dom(v\cdot a)$. We have that:
$$ L^{\emptyset, \Sigma}_r=\underset{(v,a)\in S}{\bigcup}\dom\big({L^{D_\mathsf{s}\cup D_\mathsf{t},\Sigma}_v\cdot a}\big)$$
because left parallel graphs do not have unary pure components. The set $ L^{\emptyset, \Sigma}_r$ is regular thanks to the observation above. 
\medskip

When $r\in D_\mathsf{atomic}$,  $L_r$ is regular because it is finite. 
\medskip

Let us show that $L_r$ is regular when $r\in D_\mathsf{impure}$.
Note that
$$L_r= L^{\emptyset, A_\mathsf{pure}}_r[L_v/x_v, v\in D_\mathsf{pure}]$$
The language $L^{\emptyset, A_\mathsf{pure}}_r$ is a language of multiset graphs, it regularity follows from the case of commutative words. The languages $L_v$ are regular because $v$ is pure, and this case was treated above. This concludes the proof.
