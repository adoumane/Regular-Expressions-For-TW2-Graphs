\section{Conclusion}
We are interested in studying the complexity-theoretic properties of our
expressions. For instance understanding the complexity of deciding
whether an expression is guarded, and what are the costs of translations
between different formalisms (expressions, $\CMSO$, algebra). This can
help us get a better grasp of what role these expressions can play, and
what is the fine interplay between these different formalisms.

As stated in the introduction, this work on tree-width $2$ graphs is
meant to constitute a first step towards the case of
tree-width $k$.
% We plan to continue investigating in
%this direction, by attempting to generalize this work to graphs of
%tree-width $3$ and more.
